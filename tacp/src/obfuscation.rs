//! TACACS+ Encryption/Obfuscation Algorithm
//!
//! This module provides an implementation of the obfuscation algorithm. Usage of this in modern production deployments
//! is discouraged. RFC 9887 has updated the protocol to be secured at the transport layer via TLS 1.3 or later. TLS should
//! be used wherever possible for security.
//!
//! The algorithm is described in RFC8907 Section 4.5 as follows:
//!
//! The body of packets may be obfuscated. The following sections describe the obfuscation method
//! that is supported in the protocol. In "The Draft", this process was actually referred to as
//! Encryption, but the algorithm would not meet modern standards and so will not be termed as
//! encryption in this document.
//!
//! The obfuscation mechanism relies on a secret key, a shared secret value that is known to both
//! the client and the server. The secret keys **MUST** remain secret.
//!
//! Server implementations **MUST** allow a unique secret key to be associated with each client. It
//! is a site-dependent decision as to whether or not the use of separate keys is appropriate.
//!
//! The flag field **MUST** be configured with `TAC_PLUS_UNENCRYPTED_FLAG``
//! set to - so that the packet body is obfuscated by XORing it bytewise with a pseudo-random pad:
//!
//! ENCRYPTED {data} = data ^ pseudo_pad
//!
//! The packet body can then be de-obfuscated by XORing it bytewise with a pseudo-random pad.
//!
//! data = ENCRYPTED {data} ^ pseudo_pad
//!
//! The pad is generated by concatenating a series of MD5 hashes (each 16 bytes long) and truncating it to the length of the input data.
//! Whenever used in this document, MD5 refers to the "RSA Data Security, Inc.  MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm" as specified in \[RFC1321\].
//!
//! pseudo_pad = {MD5_1 \[,MD5_2 \[ ... ,MD5_n\]\]} truncated to len(data)
//! The first MD5 hash is generated by concatenating the session_id, the secret key, the version number, and the sequence number, and then
//! running MD5 over that stream. All of those input values are available in the packet header, except for the secret key, which is a shared
//! secret between the TACACS+ client and server.
//!
//! The version number and session_id are extracted from the header.
//!
//! Subsequent hashes are
//! generated by using the same input stream but concatenating the previous hash value at the end of the input stream.
//!
//! MD5_1 = MD5{session_id, key, version, seq_no}
//!
//! MD5_2 = MD5{session_id, key, version, seq_no, MD5_1}
//!
//! ...
//!
//! MD5_n = MD5{session_id, key, version, seq_no, MD5_n-1}
//!
//! When a server detects that the secrets it has configured for the device do not match, it MUST return ERROR.
//!
//! After a packet body is de-obfuscated, the lengths of the component values in the packet are
//! summed. If the sum is not identical to the cleartext datalength value from the header, the
//! packet **MUST** be discarded and an ERROR signaled. Refer to "Session Completion" Section 4.4
//!
//! Commonly, such failures are seen when the keys are mismatched between the client and the
//! TACACS+ server.
